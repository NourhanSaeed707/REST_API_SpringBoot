## MVC Structure:
(Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:
1. Model: Manages data and business logic.
2. View: Handles layout and display.
3. Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.
